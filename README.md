# Event Data Simulation from Parametric Distributions

## Overview

This repository contains code for simulating event data using parametric distributions. The goal is to generate synthetic datasets that follow predefined probability distributions, making them useful for statistical modeling, survival analysis, and machine learning applications.

## Features

- Simulates event times based on various parametric distributions (e.g., Exponential, Weibull, Log-Normal).
- Allows customization of distribution parameters.
- Generates event times and censoring indicators where applicable.
- Outputs the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, DataFrame).
